%	If you use the results of your own published, accepted or submitted data (text or figures) in your final 
%	doctoral thesis, you have to give a clear indication of the previous work, stating the exact source of the 
%	previous material, irrespective of whether copyright is owned by you or by a publisher. This indication 
%	should take the form of 
%		a) an appropriate citation of the original source in the relevant Chapter; and 
%		b) completion of the UCL Research Paper Declaration form---this should be embedded after the 
%		Acknowledgements page in the thesis.
